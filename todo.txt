1. Setup validations across the application
2. Add front end styling for validation/error notifications
3. Convert a city into a lat long before it is stored - Not working, need to test this
4. Add a proper message for the initial modal window that is shown when a user first sees their leads page
5. Check if the tweet reply is being sent from the correct Twitter account
6. Setup the keywords page
7. Make sure duplicate tweets do not come in for a QC and do not come into the leads part of the application

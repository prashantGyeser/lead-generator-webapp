1. It will reshorten and create a new url in case the same url is repeated twice in the same reply
2. Currently only supports well formed urls i.e. http://google.com
3. Does not check for the uniqueness of a generated url, still need to implement a check
4. Shortner still does not handle a link in case it is longer after shortening in the message and the message becomes more than 140 characters after shortening
5. Links are shortened in the background, so still need to figure out how to show errors in case of messages being sent
